# Dagoth Ur bot

Abomination. 

Run ```$list``` to list enabled commands.

You can also use ```$man [command]``` to get a manual page for said command.

Both discord token and command prefix(```$``` by default) should be placed in ```.config``` file (or not, I dont care).

```.config``` file format:
```
[DEFAULT]
key = *prefix*
token = *discord token*
```
